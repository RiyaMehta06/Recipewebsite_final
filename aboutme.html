         <h2>My name is Riya Mehta</h2>
         <p>I'm 14 years old and I live in Bangalore. This website is to display some of the recipes that I found extremely delicious which are vegetarian and eggless. I have not created these recipes, but really enjoyed the food as a result of it. As a vegetarian I find it hard to find eggless recipes so this site is deidcated to that. Hope you enjoy! </p>
